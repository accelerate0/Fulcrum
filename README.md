# Fulcrum
Windows System Hardening Script Coded In Powershell and Batch For Wide Compatibility


# Help
Using Fulcrum is relatively simple.

Just Click on start.cmd and run it as Administrator



# Build Status: Stable, But Not Ready
The script *works* but it has some difficulty or ineffecient coding that will be optimized in the future.

There will be plugins that are buggy and missing features and glitches but the script works relativley stable.
It is advised not to use anywhere but images/vmware due to the risks.
